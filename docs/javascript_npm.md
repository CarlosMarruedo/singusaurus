### NPM    

#### 1) What is NPM?

> npm is the world's largest software registry. Open source developers from
> every continent use npm to share and borrow packages, and many
> organizations use npm to manage private development as well.

npm consists of three distinct components:

##### :point_right: The website
Use the website to discover packages, set up profiles, and manage other aspects of your npm experience. For example, you can set up organizations to manage access to public or private packages.

##### :point_right: The Command Line Interface (CLI)
The CLI runs from a terminal, and is how most developers interact with npm.

##### :point_right: The registry
The registry is a large public database of JavaScript software and the meta-information surrounding it.

#### Use npm to . . .

* Adapt packages of code for your apps, or incorporate packages as they are.

#### Getting started

To get started with npm, you can [create an account](#https://www.npmjs.com/signup), which will be available at http://www.npmjs.com/~*yourusername*.

After you set up an npm account, the next step is to use the command line interface (CLI) to install npm.

`npm install -g npm`

#### Checking your version of npm 
To see if you already have npm installed and check the installed version, run the following commands:

`npm -v`
