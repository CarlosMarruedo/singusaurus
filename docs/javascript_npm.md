### NPM    

### 1. What is a package manager in modern Front End Development?

> A package manager is a system or set of tools used to automate the installation, update,
> configuration, and use of software. ... Most package managers are designed to detect
> and install development tools.

### 2. What is NPM?

> npm is the world's largest software registry. Open source developers from
> every continent use npm to share and borrow packages, and many
> organizations use npm to manage private development as well.

npm consists of three distinct components:

##### :point_right: The website
Use the website to discover packages, set up profiles, and manage other aspects of your npm experience. For example, you can set up organizations to manage access to public or private packages.

##### :point_right: The Command Line Interface (CLI)
The CLI runs from a terminal, and is how most developers interact with npm.

##### :point_right: The registry
The registry is a large public database of JavaScript software and the meta-information surrounding it.

### 3. How can you install NPM? Does it matter which operating system are you using?
#### Install for Windows

Npm Enterprise requires npm 4.4.x or greater. To download the latest version of npm, on the command line, run the following command:

`npm install -g npm`

##### Checking your version of npm 
To see if you already have npm installed and check the installed version, run the following commands:

`npm -v`

#### Install for MAC
To install Npm on Mac, you will need to open a terminal window and follow the steps shown below:

##### 1. For the installation of npm we will use nvm (Node Version Manager). Enter the following command to install nvm:
`curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash`

##### 2. Next, verify the nvm installation using the following command, which should display the nvm version number:
`command -v nvm`
##### 3. It is recommended that you do an additional verification. Open the ~ / .bash_profile file and make sure the source ~ / .bashrc line is written to it, anywhere in the file. Then restart the terminal.

##### 4. Finally, run the npm -v commands to verify that npm has been installed correctly:
`$ npm -v 6.14.4`
#### Use npm to . . .

* Adapt packages of code for your apps, or incorporate packages as they are.
